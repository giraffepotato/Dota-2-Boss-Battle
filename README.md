I can't believe DC is losing, holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a picture of sunsfan and I literally screamed at her and hit the picture of sunsfan 
out of her hand. She started yelling and telling me 4 EU does not make an NA team and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed 
right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results from that series. 
I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is DC losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I 
don't want to believe that china will win TI. I want a future to believe in. I want DC to be top 6 and fix these broken invites. 
I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they were doing well in group stage???? 
This is so fucked.
